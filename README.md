# Investigating Indexes

This repository contains data and code for my blog post, <i>Investigating Index Funds</i>.

All index data was obtained from Yahoo! Finance and can be found in the Data Folder.

The code in <i>Clean Code for Investigating Index Post</i> was used to produce the multiplier data visualized in the post.

The code in <i>Brief CPI SNP correlation investigation</i> contains a brief analysis of the correlation between S&P 500 and inflation multipliers.
